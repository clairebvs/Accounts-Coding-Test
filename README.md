### Thoughts
For this code challenge, I have been focus mainly on understanding how to set up an external API call on the backend using ASP.NET core, as well as using the MVC design pattern. Understanding how I could get my data using a model, and how the controller would talk to the model to get the data that the view needs.  
In future iterations, I would like to improve the backend of my project to add more functions/methods that would handle grouping and sorting the data from the API instead of relying on the front end and using Javascript to do so. Doing that would allow me to use more adequately OOP principles such as abstraction by adding a service (handle API call) and a facade (sorting the data based on the need of the view).  
Therefore my code on the backend would be more maintainable and easier for future developers to understand.
